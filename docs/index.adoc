= Guillotine library - Documentation

Guillotine library exposes the read-only part of the Enonic Content API, including access to the Enonic query language.
Guillotine dynamically analyzes all available content types in the site and generates a GraphQL API specific to your site.
This gives you direct, typed and documented access to all content within the site.
Including the ability to follow references, child items and access media directly.

== Usage

You will need to add Enonic repository to the repository list:

....
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'http://repo.enonic.com/public'
    }
}
....

Then add the following dependency (where ``<version>`` is the actual version to use):

....
dependencies {
    include 'com.enonic.lib:lib-sql:<version>'
}
....
